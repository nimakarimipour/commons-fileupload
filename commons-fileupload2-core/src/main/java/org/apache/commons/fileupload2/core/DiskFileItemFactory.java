/**
 * The default {@link FileItemFactory} implementation.
 * <p>
 * This implementation creates {@link FileItem} instances which keep their content either in memory, for smaller items, or in a temporary file on disk, for
 * larger items. The size threshold, above which content will be stored on disk, is configurable, as is the directory in which temporary files will be created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If not otherwise configured, the default configuration values are as follows:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Size threshold is 10 KB.</li>
 * <li>Repository is the system default temporary directory, as returned by {@code System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir")}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE</b>: Files are created in the system default temporary directory with predictable names. This means that a local attacker with write access to that
 * directory can perform a TOUTOC attack to replace any uploaded file with a file of the attackers choice. The implications of this will depend on how the
 * uploaded file is used but could be significant. When using this implementation in an environment with local, untrusted users, {@link Builder#setPath(Path)}
 * MUST be used to configure a repository location that is not publicly writable. In a Servlet container the location identified by the ServletContext attribute
 * {@code javax.servlet.context.tempdir} may be used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Temporary files, which are created for file items, should be deleted later on. The best way to do this is using a {@link FileCleaningTracker}, which you can
 * set on the {@link DiskFileItemFactory}. However, if you do use such a tracker, then you must consider the following: Temporary files are automatically
 * deleted as soon as they are no longer needed. (More precisely, when the corresponding instance of {@link java.io.File} is garbage collected.) This is done by
 * the so-called reaper thread, which is started and stopped automatically by the {@link FileCleaningTracker} when there are files to be tracked. It might make
 * sense to terminate that thread, for example, if your web application ends. See the section on "Resource cleanup" in the users guide of Commons FileUpload.
